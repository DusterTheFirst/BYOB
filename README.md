# BYOB

ðŸ¤– Build your own bot

## How it will work
#### 2 ways to use

You can invite the bot to your guild and enable community made modules for said bot
 - Fast
 - No worries with hosting
 - Online webpanel and config
 
You can bundle a bunch of modules into a standalone bot that you then can run on your own server
 - Good for large servers, you have your own bot
 
## Developing modules
Download the development kit [here].
The development kit provides a local webpanel for easy communiation and interfacing with the bot.

You must create your own app [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/).
Run the bot from the commandline by running `bob`. If you would rather use the command line use argument `--noWeb`
